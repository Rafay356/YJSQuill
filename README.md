# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# PORT + Signaling
To Set Port in Window for signaling 
we need this line of code
SET PORT=4080 && node server.js 
just change the PORT on which you are running your application
once it signaling then you can synched peer to peer 
and you are good to go
# Awareness
All editor bindings that support rendering cursor information accept an awareness instance to render cursor information. If the "user" awareness field is unspecified, then the editor binding will render the cursor in a default color using a random user name.
